# User stories, use cases and use case diagrams

Your first task is to extract user stories, use cases and user diagrams from the provided text.
Refer to [projet-informatique-2017.pdf](projet-informatique-2017.pdf) for a more detailed project description.

Remember that it is your task to ask for clarifications if you run into unclear situations.
Also think about a prioritisation of the user stories and focus on what the client actually asked for ([YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it)).

Good luck!
